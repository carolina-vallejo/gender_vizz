GENDER STATISTICS
with gender inequality indicators 2012-2015

This data visualization shows gender inequality in every country of the world. The data was extracted from the World Data Bank. This visualization takes gender statistics indicators from different issues as unemployment, education, economy, etc. and calculates the average for these issues for each gender and shows if the worse average is for female or male.


This visualization gets raw data from a public document from google sheets that you can see in https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PLXntCRH6r1EfwtxTThCu2lSZT1T0DxEG3NK9ar-qQ4/pubhtml
